Public Health are we
Confused by what we should be
Nevermind, break time

Public Servants here
All in a room discussing
My email's gone quiet

Semantic pedant
get the words all correct, please
Dictionary Lost

Data to be checked
empty chair at my desk now
Laptop battery dead

Brilliant point made
Profound insight, all in awe
someone walking past

Borrowed ideas, good
writing this down on paper
no net connection

engaged loud murmur
not paying attention to this
performance review

loudest voices herd
the same ones repeatedly
quiet poems write

handing out some sheets
to read, process and engage
motivation lost
