Hair-well my friend, farewell
You’ve grown on me from day to day
But now the time has come to say
I’ll miss you like a furry hat
Flavour savers are out of favour
Cookie dusters are all a-buster
The grass grin is now on the gin
Hair-well my friend, farewell
One day you shall return
Bro-merang
As I am sure that you’ll soon learn
Hair well my friend, farewell
Alas I moustache, alas
My lipholstery has become too crass
Snot mop that you are, you’ve grown too far
Hair well my friend, farewell
