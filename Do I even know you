Looking for something you’re not going to find
I’m different to how you imagine
Crueller, kinder, I’ll never meet your expectations
Pretending to be who you think I am is doomed for failure
You’ll see a truth that is dishonest and false
Seeking validation and complicity to get closer to you
Can I afford to lose so much?
Where do I end and where does the pretence begin?
