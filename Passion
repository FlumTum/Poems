I'm not passionate enough to give you my anger
I'm not passionate enough to give you my love
These emotions are mine to do as I please

I'm not passionate enough to give you my hate
I'm not passionate enough to give you my joy
Don't doubt these feelings exist within me

I'm not passionate enough to give you my sadness
I'm not passionate enough to give you my peace
Ths is just a job to me, you have my time

You're not the one that inspires the trust that you ask for
You need the work done, so I'll do the job
My emotions are not up for sale
