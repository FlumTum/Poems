Winter forest trail
Where the frost and snow gathers
Stone floor with bare feet

24 April 2011
Gentle slope flattens out
Water softness flowing
Solid rock idly waits
Mind knows not yin or yang


4 July 2022
The comfy old shoe
Holes for the toes to poke out
I want to leave now


20 June 2023
nothing forever
even the stars will grow dim
eat snacks and live life
