First discovered in 1884
I am round in shape, and that’s not because of my diet
Commonly found in grape like clusters
My favourite colour is purple
I grow quite happily at 37°C, which is convenient, as my favourite host just happens to set its thermostat at just that temperature
You can be as salty as you like about my antics, but that just won’t affect me.
If you get enough of us together, we like to throw grand final size parties, making a hooch that will definitely sit you on your behind (in quick time too)
I’ve been known to get up to mischief, mainly through throats, open wounds, and food
If you need one more clue, I rhyme with glorious!




Not gonna lie, I’m not a fungi (fun-guy)
You can find me all over the town
I am not fussy about who I greet
Your aunt, your gran, kids, are all a treat
Bring me home I’ll visit the fam’ly.
You will all know that I have been there
As you’ll be hugging the porcelain chair
Oysters, cruise ships, or shaking a hand 
I am sure we will meet, won’t it be grand




I cause a stir when I arrive, de riguer
High temperatures I won’t survive
No toxin from me, you had better agree
I’m awf’ly common, not norm’ly a problem
I consent to only twenty percent
The rest of you I’ll gladly forget
Let me grow old, in the cold of your fridge
I love high tea, with jam, cream, and bread
Grandma? My visit she is sure to dread




You can find me on all kinds of things
I also live in you, don’t start to whinge
Easy to neglect, you’re bound to regret
So, wash your hands, and do not forget
Ah, please don’t be rude, there is no need. 
Take care, because I can make you bleed
I’ll not decline, if you’re up for boxin’ 
As I can make the most wonderful toxin
Not good for kidneys, of child or adult
So just keep watch, for I am all about
I’m not normally quite so scary
Only if you’re extraordin’ly unwary
I might be common, but I’m no small fry
It’s been nice ta meet’cha, and that’s no lie




I’m a hardy one, I’ll give you that
Cook me, chill me, or can me right up
Too low or too slow, I am sure to grow
With time to thrive I’ll leave a piece behind
You bores, you snore, oh my spore just adore
And then you’ll be stuffed, your reckless ol’ duff
Rockin’ a delicious ol’ toxin
I’ve no hankerin’ for ox’gen
Acid’s the thing, for long shelf life to bring
All my plans to a wreck and a mess
