Confusion about us:
Can we be lovers
Or are we to be just friends
Yet, I still love you

//First day back for the year 11 Jan 2023
Oh, sweet summer bliss
Your warm and loving embrace
Wake up you'll be late

Word games with friends:
With some pride, admit
Quordle is my go to game
Win, not every one

Even in darkness
Humanity shines a light
Look the moon pretty

An afternoon nap:
Dreaming or awake
Living in one world only
Alright, things to do
