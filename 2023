Confusion about us:
Can we be lovers
Or are we to be just friends
Yet, I still love you

//First day back for the year 11 Jan 2023
Oh, sweet summer bliss
Your warm and loving embrace
Wake up you'll be late

Word games with friends:
With some pride, admit
Quordle is my go to game
Win, not every one

Even in darkness
Humanity shines a light
Look the moon pretty

An afternoon nap:
Dreaming or awake
Living in one world only
Alright, things to do

I've fallen in love
My thoughts chase me all around
This fucks up my life

Don't call me good
It encourages me to violence
Fuck your morality

Don't call me good
I don't know what you mean
Shit on your opinion

I knew a good man
The world told me it was so
Secrets destroyed me

Don't call me good
You're saying I'm like him
Good isn't worth shit

Seeking approval
I want you to like me more
Unwanted advance

A new pair to watch
My hormones on overdrive
Try not to stare, eh

How was your first day
It was ok, nothing happened
This tells me nothing

Answered a question
You don't believe what I said
Ask someone else then

Couple on the bed
It's not what you are thinking
Care for each other

The risk of sharing
The silence is deafening
Hmm, too much again

There is none like you
I want you to know it all
Cannot be perfect

AIFST Fermentation Workshop:
Want you to like me
Over sharing, said too much
The filter turned off

Don't let people close
Fewer chances to be hurt
Need intimacy

Trying to stand out
Even with perfected style
My smile is ignored

Sandwiches for lunch
Again the bread with fillings
Got some hot chips, nom
