That shit will stick
It is never coming off
It stays with you

Some things I'd like to undo
Some things I'd like to unsee
Some line left uncrossed

But I can't undo
I can't take back
I carry the imprint on my soul

The people I've hurt remind me
Perfection is out of reach
I can't undo what has been done

A poor replacement remains
No not do again, refrain
Learn from mistakes, atone
Hold myself to a higher standard
