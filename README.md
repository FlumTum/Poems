# Poems
I like to imagine that I have some skill at writing.
So here is the evidence one way or the other

I find inspiration in the events of my life.
It may be a dream, or some random thought
More often life events that I can't control 

I write things down as a way to understand
They help me regulate my emotions

If these in any way resonate, that's a comfort
