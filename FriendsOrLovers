In the style of a song:

If you say yes,
I'm going to wonder
If you say no,
I'll be heartbroken
Don't answer
Pretend I never asked

Why does it matter
What difference does it make
Am I so easily mistrusted
Are my motivations opaque

A friend is a friend
We need somone to share
Romance in a trance
I can feel it's unfair

A lifetime of worry
Hours and days of care
I didn't mean to scare you
There was no love affair

My focus divided
my heart torn in two
I fall so easily
But I've always loved you

I defend myself, yes
I fear to lose you
Could it be seen truly
From an outsider's view

I don't know my heart
I don;t know my mind
I have too many worries
Not meaning to be unkind

Always lacking the words
Fear to say the wrong thing
Silence stretches on and out
Your doubts creeping in
