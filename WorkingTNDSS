much work done today
fingers aching from the strain
oops, there goes my bus

draw me back to work
night time sleep is far too short
pay me overtime!

//alternate last line
is there overtime?

the feeling in the first one is more aggressive, the second apepealing toward an overworked employee needing the extra motivation but not expecting any relief.

The rest of the team is now inspired. Some of my additional creations:

trying to poem
writing choices are all bad
this almost works, eh?
//in response to complaints about it being hard to write haiku. Agreed!

chat name is changing
must we all become poets?
what if there's no wit?
//in response to the chat channel having it's name changed to HAIKU CHAT
