Privilege
What do I want with this hsit
I got is all and you know why
I didn’t ask for it, I didn’t request it, I didn’t put in an order through Amazon
And nobody delivered it, except my mum
she brought me into this, but it isn’t her fault either
I’m white and I’m a man
The whole world is underneath me and the history I carry
It’s all good so long as you can pretend you’re one of the good ones
But that is bullshit
I don’t need to try harder
I don’t need to work harder
I don’t need to walk in fear
I don’t need to walk in shame (except that I should)
You tell me sorry, that you’re sorry
But it’s not me your telling
It’s the history your carrying
The history I’m carrying
You don’t need to tell me, as me, that you’re sorry
You haven’t done anything wrong
I know this because i saw that you didn't do anything wrong
But you say sorry like you’re afraid the history I carry is going to come down on your head
That’s one reason, but I’ll tell you this, there is another reason
There are others born to this privilege that think they deserve where they are
That think the history they carry is theirs to own and use
They are going to think that you should be sorry
And that reflex verbal apology you give them isn’t nearly enough
They are going to want to make you be sorry
And they are going to think they are justified, righteous, and good while they do it
Sorry.
I am sorry you have to be sorry
I know you don’t have to be
But you have reason to need to be sorry
And by looking at me, you can’t tell if the sorry you give is the right sorry
You can’t tell if I’m going to accept your sorry or make you be truly sorry
Fuck justification
Fuck righteousness
And Fuck being good
Those things are just privilege talking and it doesn’t deserve air to breathe
